# ULTIMATE-CAT
🐱 Ultimate Cat Experience

An interactive, cinematic web experience built for fun, creativity, and experimentation.

This project blends dynamic content, animated storytelling, and immersive audio-visual effects into a single playful experience. Users progress through a sequence of cats, and once the journey is complete, everything escalates — bouncing animations, fullscreen video, and music that fades in at the perfect moment.

Built not as a template, but as a creative playground to explore modern frontend techniques and timing-based animations.
